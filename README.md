Inbix Ideation Challenge- Neural Network Model
Code works as a Neural Network Model using MLP classifier.
Data is normalized for pre processing to remove outliers and scale data. Feature Selection is done using selectkbest method which implements f test classification as score function. 
There are various combinations of Solvers and Activation Functions and Hidden Layer sizes that can be used.
